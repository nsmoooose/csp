/**
 * @file System.h
 *
 * Vehicle systems base classes and infrastructure.
 *
 * Detailed models of vehicle behavior are composed of multiple System
 * subclasses.  Each System subclass represents a particular aspect or
 * subcomponent of a vehicle.  Some systems subclasses are direct
 * analogs to real-world vehicle subsystems (e.g. a fire-control radar),
 * while other model general behavior, logic, or interactions with the
 * environment.  For example, the flight model of an aircraft is
 * implemented as a system.
 *
 * Systems act as nodes in a tree, so that each system can have multiple
 * subsystems.  The unique root of a systems tree is a subclass of
 * SystemsModel.  Loosely speaking, the systems model represents the
 * entire collection of subsystems forming the tree.  System models can
 * be attached to DynamicObjects to provide logic, physics, and
 * interfaces appropriate to the specific vehicle being simulated.
 *
 * Actions on systems models are typically implemented using the
 * visitor pattern, whereby an instance of a Visitor subclass is passed
 * to the systems model, and then recursively to all children until
 * each node of the tree has been visited.  At each node, the visitor
 * selectively performs its intended operation.
 *
 * In addition to visitors, which provide external access to the systems
 * model, individual subsystems can communicate directly using the
 * system bus.  The bus is a class that acts as a broker for data channels
 * defined by the subsystems.  When the system model is first constructed,
 * each subsystem exports a set of data channels to the bus.  Once this
 * process is complete, the systems may request to import channels from
 * other subsystems.  The coordination of importers and exporters is
 * handled entirely by the bus.  Other than its immediate subsystems, a
 * given system has no direct knowledge of the other systems in the
 * systems model.
 *
 * The data channels that are shared by the subsystems are identified by
 * a string identifier.  This one system may export "aileron_deflection"
 * to the bus, and another may request "aileron_deflection" from the bus.
 * Once the connection is established, each subsystem holds a reference
 * to the shared datachannel object that allows for efficient communication
 * without additional string lookups.  Each data channel is strongly typed,
 * and provides various signaling methods including both active and passive
 * push and pull.
 *
 * The systems model and subsystems conform to the InputInterface interface,
 * allowing input events to propagate to the subsystems that handle them.
 * Thus a keyboard event that maps to the "radar_lock" action would be
 * passed to the active object, down to the systems model, and through the
 * systems tree until the radar subsytem finally handled the event.
 *
 * Subsystems support synchronous, delayed updates.  Each subsystem can
 * implement an onUpdate(dt) method to perform updates.  The return value
 * indicates the minimum amount of time until the next update.  Systems
 * requiring per frame updates (e.g. a flight model) would return 0.0,
 * while less demanding systems can request less frequent updates.
