Combat Simulator Project dev-pack 0.4 (December 2004) for use with
CSPSim 0.4 (in progress)

INSTALLATION:

1. Unzip this package on your system (make sure the complete
   path doesn't contain any spaces). This will create a usr
   folder containing \include, \lib and \bin subdirectories.

2. Add usr\bin to the system path. Updates to the system
   path will take effect after a reboot.

3. Add usr\include and usr\lib to VC++ directories so that
   the compiler will find the new headers and libraries. You
   may need to exit and restart VC++ for these changes to
   take effect.

Note: You may already have an older version of a dll provided
in this pack; if you get dynamic link errors (typically
"non-existent entry points"), try to copy the problematic dll
from \bin into APPLICATIONS\CSPSim\Bin to force the dev pack
version to be loaded first when running CSPSim.
