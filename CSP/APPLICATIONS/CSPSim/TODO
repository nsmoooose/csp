////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// CODE RELATED

Send useful error messages to stderr for missing files
(especially during startup!) and make sure these are
also logged to CSPSim.log no matter what logging level
is set.  The error messages should detail what file is
missing, where it belongs, and where to download it.

Catch exceptions / assertion from the mainloop and 
print more useful error messages.  Some CSP exception 
classes probably need to be written. [PARTIALLY DONE]


////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// DATA RELATED

Change Models/m2kg2.3DS to Models/m2kg2.3ds

Add Images/moon.png to a supplemental data distribution

Change the root path in the BalkanTerrain distribution
so it can be unpacked in the main CSPSim directory (right
now you have to unpack it in CSPSim/Data)
