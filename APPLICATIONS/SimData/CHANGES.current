Version 0.3.3 (in progress)
===========================

2003-05-03: onsight
            Made static log variables into class members, so that multiple logs
	    can exist in one application.  Since SimData itself uses the logging
	    classes, this was necessary for it to be useful as a library class
	    (and just makes much more sense).
	   
            Changed the log method set_output() to setOutput().
