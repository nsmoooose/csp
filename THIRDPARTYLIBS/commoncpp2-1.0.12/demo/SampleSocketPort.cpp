/**
 *
 *	This class demonstrates use of the CommonC++ SocketPort class.
 *
 *	Copyright 2001 - Nick Liebmann <nick@ukmail.org>
 *	
 *	The SampleSocketPort is an implementation of the CommonC++ SocketPort class
 *	that irons out some problems that I found with disconnection, and also demonstrates
 *	a way of using the SocketPort to reliably extract and send data from/to a TCP/IP socket.
 *	
 *	In addition to this the SampleSocketPort includes some additional functionality
 *	to determine whether the data stream has become corrupted
 *	(missing terminator / incorrect formatting). For this feature a timer is used which if it is
 *	allowed to expire, indicates that a 'packet' took too long to arrive, and as such the data 
 *	in the buffer is 'corrupt'.
 *	
 *	The SampleSocketPort can be used as-is...Modify the contents of the pending()
 *	function if your data is formatted differently to the default (i.e. not terminated with \r\n)
 *	
 *	
 *	This sample code is distributed under the same terms and conditions of the CommonC++ library.
 *	
 *	CHANGE HISTORY:
 *	
 *	
 *	07/01/02	NL		There have been slight changes to the way CommonC++ starts threads,
 *						a possible bug in InetHostAddress constructor, and a bug fix for SocketService
 *						#496276. The following changes address those issues
 *						
 *						New thread start semantics. SocketService Thread is now explicitly started 
 *						by the SampleSocketServiceServer.
 *						
 *						Added SampleSocketServiceServer::StartServer() to start the server and wait 
 *						for the thread to get up and running.
 *						
 *						Added SampleSocketServiceServer::StopServer() to cleanly stop the server, and
 *						ensure that there are no partially constructed SocketPorts left lying around
 *						
 *						Removed setDetectOutput(true)...this does not seem to be required anymore
 *						as the SocketService functions correctly now.
 *						
 *						InetHostAddress constructor does not treat INADDR_ANY as it used to.
 *						
 *	07/01/02	NL		main() - now waits for a 'quit' command, and deletes the Server object.
