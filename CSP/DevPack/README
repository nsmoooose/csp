Combat Simulator Project dev-pack 0.4 (December 2004) for use with
CSPSim 0.4 (in progress)

CSP is hosted at http://csp.sourceforge.net
Development server is https://www.zerobar.net/csp

This development package is a collection of precompiled libraries
and header files.  Most of the libraries were compiled with Microsoft
VisualStudio professional .net 2003 (aka 7.1) on a MS Windows XP pro
system.  The header files are located in \include, while the library
files (in general export libs but also some static ones) are in \lib
and dlls are in \bin.  This pack is distributed in the hope that it
will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY.  Source code for all
precompiled libraries is available from their respective hosting
sites, which are listed below.
