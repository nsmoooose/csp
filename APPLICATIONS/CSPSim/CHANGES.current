 Version 0.3.4 (in progress)
===========================

2003-08-05: onsight
            Initial updates to use new SimData APIs for Random,
	    Vector3, Matrix3, Quat.  Dynamics seem correct but
	    more testing is needed.

	    Fixed euler angles.  The new code preconverts to/from
	    CSP's internal coordinate system rather than relying
	    on a special method in SimData.
