Combat Simulator Project - Devpack 0.6 for Windows

This package contains header files and prebuilt libraries of third-party
packages needed to build CSP.  This package is provided simply as a convenience
to those building CSP on the Microsoft Windows platform; the original source
distributions of these libraries may also be downloaded from their respective
websites and built manually.

See COPYING and LICENSES for details about the third-party libraries included
in this package.

Note that in addition to these libraries, the Microsoft Platform SDK and
Microsoft Visual C++ compiler may be needed to build CSP from source.  Also
be aware that the CSP build system uses the CSPDEVPACK environment variable
to locate the devpack libraries and headers.  This variable is set FOR THE
CURRENT USER ONLY via the registry during the installation process.  You
may need to manually configure this variable if the devpack installation
is shared between multiple users on a single machine.

All binary libraries included in this package were built under Microsoft
Windows XP SP2 using the Microsoft 32-bit C/C++ Optimizing Compiler Version
14.00.50215.44, with the exception of OpenAL, which was copied directly from
the OpenAL 1.1 SDK.  Unless otherwise noted, the /O2 and /MD compiler switches
and the /RELEASE switch were used.  The libraries depend on standard system
libraries, as well as Microsoft Visual C++ runtime libraries (msvcr80.dll and
msvcrp80.dll), which are not included in this package.
