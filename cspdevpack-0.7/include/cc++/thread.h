/**
 * The Mutex class is used to protect a section of code so that at any
 * given time only a single thread can perform the protected operation.
 * 
 * The Mutex can be used as a base class to protect access in a derived
 * class.  When used in this manner, the ENTER_CRITICAL and LEAVE_CRITICAL
 * macros can be used to specify when code written for the derived class
 * needs to be protected by the default Mutex of the derived class, and
 * hence is presumed to be 'thread safe' from multiple instance execution.
 * One of the most basic Common C++ synchronization object is the Mutex
 * class.  A Mutex only allows one thread to continue execution at a given
 * time over a specific section of code.  Mutex's have a enter and leave
 * method; only one thread can continue from the Enter until the Leave is
 * called.  The next thread waiting can then get through.  Mutex's are also
 * known as "CRITICAL SECTIONS" in win32-speak.
 * 
 * The Mutex is always recursive in that if the same thread invokes
 * the same mutex lock multiple times, it must release it multiple times.
 * This allows a function to call another function which also happens to
 * use the same mutex lock when called directly. This was
 * deemed essential because a mutex might be used to block individual file
 * requests in say, a database, but the same mutex might be needed to block a
 * whole series of database updates that compose a "transaction" for one
 * thread to complete together without having to write alternate non-locking
 * member functions to invoke for each part of a transaction.
 * 
 * Strangely enough, the original pthread draft standard does not directly
 * support recursive mutexes.  In fact this is the most common "NP" extension
 * for most pthread implementations.  Common C++ emulates recursive mutex
 * behavior when the target platform does not directly support it.
 * 
 * In addition to the Mutex, Common C++ supports a rwlock class.  This
 * implements the X/Open recommended "rwlock".  On systems which do not
 * support rwlock's, the behavior is emulated with a Mutex; however, the
 * advantage of a rwlock over a mutex is then entirely lost.  There has been
 * some suggested clever hacks for "emulating" the behavior of a rwlock with
 * a pair of mutexes and a semaphore, and one of these will be adapted for
 * Common C++ in the future for platforms that do not support rwlock's
 * directly.

 * class. Classes derived from Thread must implement the run() method,
 * which specifies the code of the thread. The base Thread class
 * supports encapsulation of the generic threading methods implemented
 * on various target operating systems.  This includes the ability to
 * start and stop threads in a synchronized and controllable manner,
 * the ability to specify thread execution priority, and thread
 * specific "system call" wrappers, such as for sleep and yield.  A
 * thread exception is thrown if the thread cannot be created.
 * Threading was the first part of Common C++ I wrote, back when it
 * was still the APE library.  My goal for Common C++ threading has
 * been to make threading as natural and easy to use in C++
 * application development as threading is in Java.  With this said,
 * one does not need to use threading at all to take advantage of
 * Common C++.  However, all Common C++ classes are designed at least
 * to be thread-aware/thread-safe as appropriate and necessary.
 * 
 * Common C++ threading is currently built either from the Posix "pthread"
 * library or using the win32 SDK.  In that the Posix "pthread" draft
 * has gone through many revisions, and many system implementations are
 * only marginally compliant, and even then usually in different ways, I
 * wrote a large series of autoconf macros found in ost_pthread.m4 which
 * handle the task of identifying which pthread features and capabilities
 * your target platform supports.  In the process I learned much about what
 * autoconf can and cannot do for you..
 * 
 * Currently the GNU Portable Thread library (GNU pth) is not directly
 * supported in Common C++.  While GNU "Pth" doesn't offer direct
 * native threading support or benefit from SMP hardware, many of the design
 * advantages of threading can be gained from it's use, and the  Pth pthread
 * "emulation" library should be usable with Common C++.  In the future,
 * Common C++ will directly support Pth, as well as OS/2 and BeOS native
 * threading API's.
 * 
 * Common C++ itself defines a fairly "neutral" threading model that is
 * not tied to any specific API such as pthread, win32, etc.  This neutral
 * thread model is contained in a series of classes which handle threading
 * and synchronization and which may be used together to build reliable
 * threaded applications.
 * 
 * Common C++ defines application specific threads as objects which are
 * derived from the Common C++ "Thread" base class.  At minimum the "Run"
 * method must be implemented, and this method essentially is the "thread",
 * for it is executed within the execution context of the thread, and when
 * the Run method terminates the thread is assumed to have terminated.
 * 
 * Common C++ allows one to specify the running priority of a newly created
 * thread relative to the "parent" thread which is the thread that is
 * executing when the constructor is called.  Since most newer C++
 * implementations do not allow one to call virtual constructors or virtual
 * methods from constructors, the thread must be "started" after the
 * constructor returns.  This is done either by defining a "starting"
 * semaphore object that one or more newly created thread objects can wait
 * upon, or by invoking an explicit "start" member function.
 * 
 * Threads can be "suspended" and "resumed".  As this behavior is not defined
 * in the Posix "pthread" specification, it is often emulated through
 * signals.  Typically SIGUSR1 will be used for this purpose in Common C++
 * applications, depending in the target platform.  On Linux, since threads
 * are indeed processes, SIGSTP and SIGCONT can be used.  On solaris, the
 * Solaris thread library supports suspend and resume directly.
 * 
 * Threads can be canceled.  Not all platforms support the concept of
 * externally cancelable threads.  On those platforms and API
 * implementations that do not, threads are typically canceled through the
 * action of a signal handler.
 * 
 * As noted earlier, threads are considered running until the "Run" method
 * returns, or until a cancellation request is made.  Common C++ threads can
 * control how they respond to cancellation, using setCancellation().
 * Cancellation requests can be ignored, set to occur only when a
 * cancellation "point" has been reached in the code, or occur immediately.
 * Threads can also exit by returning from Run() or by invoking the Exit()
 * method.
 * 
 * Generally it is a good practice to initialize any resources the thread may
 * require within the constructor of your derived thread class, and to purge
 * or restore any allocated resources in the destructor.  In most cases, the
 * destructor will be executed after the thread has terminated, and hence
 * will execute within the context of the thread that requested a join rather
 * than in the context of the thread that is being terminated.  Most
 * destructors in derived thread classes should first call Terminate() to
 * make sure the thread has stopped running before releasing resources.
 * 
 * A Common C++ thread is normally canceled by deleting the thread object.
 * The process of deletion invokes the thread's destructor, and the
 * destructor will then perform a "join" against the thread using the
 * Terminate() function.  This behavior is not always desirable since the
 * thread may block itself from cancellation and block the current "delete"
 * operation from completing.  One can alternately invoke Terminate()
 * directly before deleting a thread object.
 * 
 * When a given Common C++ thread exits on it's own through it's Run()
 * method, a "Final" method will be called.  This Final method will be called
 * while the thread is "detached".  If a thread object is constructed through
 * a "new" operator, it's final method can be used to "self delete" when
 * done, and allows an independent thread to construct and remove itself
 * autonomously.
 * 
 * A special global function, getThread(), is provided to identify the thread
 * object that represents the current execution context you are running
 * under.  This is sometimes needed to deliver signals to the correct thread.
 * Since all thread manipulation should be done through the Common C++ (base) 
 * thread class itself, this provides the same functionality as things like
 * "pthread_self" for Common C++.
 *
 * All Common C++ threads have an exception "mode" which determines
 * their behavior when an exception is thrown by another Common C++
 * class.  Extensions to Common C++ should respect the current
 * exception mode and use getException() to determine what to do when
 * they are about to throw an object.  The default exception mode
 * (defined in the Thread() constructor) is throwObject, which causes
 * a pointer to an instance of the class where the error occured to be
 * thrown.  Other exception modes are throwException, which causes a
 * class-specific exception class to be thrown, and throwNothing,
 * which causes errors to be ignored.  
 *
 * As an example, you could try to call the Socket class with an
 * invalid address that the system could not bind to.  This would
 * cause an object of type Socket * to be thrown by default, as the
 * default exception mode is throwObject.  If you call
 * setException(throwException) before the bad call to the Socket
 * constructor, an object of type SockException (the exception class
 * for class Socket) will be thrown instead.  
 *
 * To determine what exception class is thrown by a given Common C++
 * class when the exception mode is set to throwException, search the
 * source files for the class you are interested in for a class which
 * inherits directly or indirectly from class Exception.  This is the
 * exception class which would be thrown when the exception mode is
 * set to throwException.
 *
 * The advantage of using throwException versus throwObject is that
 * more information is available to the programmer from the thrown
 * object.  All class-specific exceptions inherit from class
 * Exception, which provides a getString() method which can be called
 * to get a human-readable error string.
 * 
 * Common C++ threads are often aggregated into other classes to provide
 * services that are "managed" from or operate within the context of a
 * thread, even within the Common C++ framework itself.  A good example of
 * this is the TCPSession class, which essentially is a combination of a TCP
 * client connection and a separate thread the user can define by deriving a
 * class with a Run() method to handle the connected service.  This
 * aggregation logically connects the successful allocation of a given
 * resource with the construction of a thread to manage and perform 
 * operations for said resource.
 * 
 * Threads are also used in "service pools".  In Common C++, a service pool
 * is one or more threads that are used to manage a set of resources.  While
 * Common C++ does not provide a direct "pool" class, it does provide a model
 * for their implementation, usually by constructing an array of thread
 * "service" objects, each of which can then be assigned the next new
 * instance of a given resource in turn or algorithmically.
 * 
 * Threads have signal handlers associated with them.  Several signal types
 * are "predefined" and have special meaning.  All signal handlers are
 * defined as virtual member functions of the Thread class which are called
 * when a specific signal is received for a given thread.  The "SIGPIPE"
 * event is defined as a "Disconnect" event since it's normally associated
 * with a socket disconnecting or broken fifo.  The Hangup() method is
 * associated with the SIGHUP signal.  All other signals are handled through
 * the more generic Signal().
 * 
 * Incidently, unlike Posix, the win32 API has no concept of signals, and
 * certainly no means to define or deliver signals on a per-thread basis.
 * For this reason, no signal handling is supported or emulated in the win32
 * implementation of Common C++ at this time.
 * 
 * In addition to TCPStream, there is a TCPSession class which combines a
 * thread with a TCPStream object.  The assumption made by TCPSession is that
 * one will service each TCP connection with a separate thread, and this
 * makes sense for systems where extended connections may be maintained and
 * complex protocols are being used over TCP.

/**
 * This class is used to access non-reentrant date and time functions in the
 * standard C library.
 *
 * The class has two purposes:
 * - 1 To be used internaly in CommonCpp's date and time classes to make them
 *     thread safe.
 * - 2 To be used by clients as thread safe replacements to the standard C
 *     functions, much like Thread::sleep() represents a thread safe version
 *     of the standard sleep() function.
 *
 * @note The class provides one function with the same name as its equivalent
 *       standard function and one with another, unique name. For new clients,
 *       the version with the unique name is recommended to make it easy to
 *       grep for accidental usage of the standard functions. The version with
 *       the standard name is provided for existing clients to sed replace their
 *       original version.
 *
 * @note Also note that some functions that returned pointers have been redone
 *       to take that pointer as an argument instead, making the caller
 *       responsible for memory allocation/deallocation. This is almost
 *       how POSIX specifies *_r functions (reentrant versions of the
 *       standard time functions), except the POSIX functions also return the
 *       given pointer while we do not. We don't use the *_r functions as they
 *       aren't all generally available on all platforms yet.
