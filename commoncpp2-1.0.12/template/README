The Common C++ template library will focus on many design elements 
commonly used in Common C++ applications.  These include things like
self-organizing objects, which I often use in place of "containers".
This set of template libraries is kept seperate from the main Common C++
distribution sources to clearify which are part of the template library
and which are part of the mainline source distribution.

This is being written for Common C++ 2.0.
