/**
 * The Serial class is used as the base for all serial I/O services
 * under APE.  A serial is a system serial port that is used either
 * for line or packet based data input.  Serial ports may also be
 * "streamable" in a derived form.
 * 
 *  Common C++ serial I/O classes are used to manage serial devices and
 *  implement serial device protocols.  From the point of view of Common C++,
 *  serial devices are supported by the underlying Posix specified "termios"
 *  call interface.
 * 
 *  The serial I/O base class is used to hold a descriptor to a serial device
 *  and to provide an exception handling interface for all serial I/O classes.
 *  The base class is also used to specify serial I/O properties such as
 *  communication speed, flow control, data size, and parity.  The "Serial"
 *  base class is not itself directly used in application development,
 *  however.
 * 
 *  Common C++ Serial I/O is itself divided into two conceptual modes; frame
 *  oriented and line oriented I/O.  Both frame and line oriented I/O makes
 *  use of the ability of the underlying tty driver to buffer data and return
 *  "ready" status from when select either a specified number of bytes or
 *  newline record has been reached by manipulating termios c_cc fields
 *  appropriately.  This provides some advantage in that a given thread
 *  servicing a serial port can block and wait rather than have to continually
 *  poll or read each and every byte as soon as it appears at the serial port.
 *
