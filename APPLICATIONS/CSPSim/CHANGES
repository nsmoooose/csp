            Cleaning code for ScreenInfo and ScreenInfoManager. It still
            needs some improvements but it should be better now. Note that
            osgText has been entirely reimplemented. Although, I didn t use
            it, we ll need to switch to it soon: more flexible interface,
            robuster and faster code.

            I added a Runge-Kutta method RK_24, with a predictive step and a
            corrective one; it is implemented as an abstract class in
            DynamicalSystem (.cpp & .h). A dynamical system is roughly
            speaking a system of differential equations (ODE); a pure
            virtual method is the vector field which looks like vector
            f(time,vector); here, vector is a std::vector<double> of any
            dimension; you need to pass its size when you instantiate a
            DynamicalSystem. This class is generic and could be use as soon
            as a vector field may be defined.

            Aerodynamics inherites now from DynamicalSystem. I ve done some
            minor cleaning in code and implement some helper functions to
            use with dynamical system. Call to this numerical method occurs
            in doSimStep2; it will be keep until others will have tested it
            enough (so, old code is still available and functional - just 1
            line to be changed to switch back).

            I added a line in CSPSim.ini to read sound files (still
            hardcoded). At the moment, SDL API is used but it should be
            replaced by OpenAL soon (Wolverine is working on it). Looks like
            that here:

            SoundPath = ../Data/Sounds

            Changed the radius of skydome to 64000 (hardcoded!, pkz Onsight,
            check it)

            Others changes are minor.
