  does not bear any relation to the sound in the real jet.

  Actual VMU sound sampled from a real F-16 HUD video.  Given that the original
  sound was produced by the US Government I don't believe this sample can be
  protected by copyright.  Even if copyrighted, I expect that the short duration
  of this sample would fall under fair use.
