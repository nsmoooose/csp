IMPORTANT NOTE:
All examples expect that you run them from the csp folder. So to run the sky 
example you must do the following:

  examples/sky/.bin/sky

For windows users you must also have added paths to the the csplib.dll and cspsim.dll. 
This is normally done from sim.py. These examples are pure c++ and will need this path
assigned. On linux it simply works.
