General usage:
- Run sdl-viewer without arguments: Loads a default scene (hard coded).
- Add [Theater_Name] as argument: Load a scene from XML data. There must be a corresponding Theater_Name.xml file in /csp/data/xml/theater. "sdl-viewer.exe balkan" should always work.

Hint for Windows users:
This example application must be run from the CSP root directory in order to find the correct data file paths. To make this a little bit easier, the scripts below can be used (run them from the CSP root directory).

Set the required paths:

set WORKING_DIRECTORY=%cd%
set PATH=%PATH%;%CSPDEVPACK%\bin
set PATH=%PATH%;%WORKING_DIRECTORY%\csplib\.bin\;%WORKING_DIRECTORY%\cspsim\.bin;%WORKING_DIRECTORY%\cspwf\.bin
set PATH=%PATH%;%WORKING_DIRECTORY%\modules\demeter\.bin

Run the SDL Viewer example application:

examples\sdl-viewer\.bin\sdl-viewer.exe %1 %2 %3
