CREATING A DEMO RELEASE OF CSPSIM FOR WINDOWS
=============================================

In this directory, run:

> python makedemo.py VERSION

where VERSION is of the form major.minor (e.g., "0.5").  This will create
a subdirectory named CSPSim-Demo-VERSION that contains all of the necessary
modules, dlls, and data.   Note that if any system libraries are reported as
"missing" you may have to copy them by hand to this directory and repeat the
makedemo command.

After makedemo has completed successfully, update the README and LICENSE files
in the CSPSim-Demo-VERSION subdirectory.  Zip the entire directory to create
the demo release: CSPSim-Demo-VERSION.zip.  Unzip this file in C:\tmp and test
that the sim runs correctly.  Ideally repeat this test on another computer
that isn't used for CSP development.  When everything looks good, upload the
zip file to the CSP project page at SourceForge and announce the new demo on
the forums.

Another way of creating a demo is using the NSIS install script. NSIS (Nullsoft Scriptable Install System - see http://nsis.sf.net) is a tool to create Windows installers. The file "InstallScript_CSPSim-Demo-X.Y.nsi" can be run from a NSIS GUI like VenisIX (see http://www.spaceblue.com/venis - it's free for non-profit use). When placed in the same directory as "makedemo.py", it zips the whole CSPSim-Demo-X.Y folder to a single "setup.exe" file. The NSIS script needs to be adapted to the current version of the CSPSim demo. All you have to do is to change all directory names in the script and set them to the actual CSPSim demo directory (e.g. "!insertmacro MUI_PAGE_LICENSE "./CSPSim-Demo-0.5/COPYING") The next step is compiling the script (Tools->Compile in VenisIX), and building the Setup.exe file.
