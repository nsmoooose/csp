This directory will include demo programs that were used for testing out the
APE library.  These demos are not nessisarly meant to serve any purpose
other than educational.  They are not normally "built" unless you enter this
directory, and they are not meant to be "installed" for general use.  They
are here both to educate how APE works and for internal testing.
