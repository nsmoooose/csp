COMBAT SIMULATOR PROJECT
=============================================================================


INTRODUCTION

The Combat Simulator Project (CSP) is an open-source community united by the
common interest in combat simulator development. We are developing standards,
technologies, code libraries, tools and artwork that can be used to build a
wide variety of real-time combat simulators. Our ultimate goal is to realize
concurrent and networked cross-platform simulation of large-scale multi-
vehicle combat scenarios.

CSP is open for all to join.  We invite everyone with interest in simulators
and simulator development to support, join, or in any way participate and
contribute to this project.  Please visit our forum and wiki for more
information (links below).

Current development is centered around CSPSim, which implements a single
player flight simulation, as well as constructing a general simulation
framework.


BUILDING CSPSIM

Start by installing all the external dependencies (OpenSceneGraph, SDL, etc);
see http://csp.sf.net/wiki/CurrentBuildDependecies for more info.

The bare bones instructions for linux are setup, build, and run:
	$ sudo ./setup.py
	$ scons all
	$ cd CSPSim/Bin && ./CSPSim.py

The bare bones instructions for windows are:
	Run ./setup.py (as admin under XP)
	Open and build the various projects found in the top-level subdirectories.
	Run CSPSim/Bin/CSPSim.py
