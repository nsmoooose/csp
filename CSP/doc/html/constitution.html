                Simulator Project is a volunteer effort to create a large multiplayer network of open source combat simulators.&nbsp; The project covers a broad range of subprojects, in which everyone can contribute any kind of useful 
                resource.&nbsp; This <I>constitution</I>
                 provides the framework for how decisions will be made, and who can make them.&nbsp; This system of project decisions will be done in a democratic way, but will also be based on merit.&nbsp; There will be 5 levels of participation in the project.&nbsp; Each level will have different rights and responsibilities for the direction of the project.&nbsp; This system will offer greatest flexibility for managing task, and will not be dependent on any particular individual for the overall success of the project.&nbsp; It is important to note that this document is only a starting point and may be further refined and improved as the project progresses.

                system and allows everybody to subscribe and participate on the forums.&nbsp; We do however identify several participation levels, each of them of equal importance, but with different rights and responsibilities. The five levels 
                are: 
                <UL TYPE="DISC">
                    <B><I>

                    <B><I>
                    <LI>Active User</I>s <I>-</I></B>
                         read and respond on the forums. Learn from others and teach others something they know (problems they had and how to work around them, bug reports, feature requests and so on). This category doesn't contribute any code but is equally important for finding bugs and to keep the project with feet on the ground. By committing code patches, active users become developers. 
                    </LI>
                    <B><I>
                    <LI>Developers - </I></B>write code, patches or contribute to the project in some other ways (documentation, scripts, other resources). </LI>

                    <LI>Active Developer</I>s<I> - </I></B>are those developers who give more than one significant contribution or show enough interest in continuing the development of some part of the project and ask to become one. At this time, 
                        your request is taken into consideration and voted by the others active developers, if nobody is against it, you will be given write access to the CVS repository and you will be able to vote and rule the project. </LI>
                    <B><I>
                    <LI>Passive Developer</I>s<I> - </I></B>are those active developers who left the project or did not contribute code, votes, mails or any other resource for at least half a year. Passive developers are considered out of the 
                        project but they CVS access is never restricted unless the person asks for it or no active developer is against this in a formal voting. </FONT></LI>

                Every active developer has the right to vote. Each vote can be made in one of three ways: 
                <UL TYPE="DISC">
                    <B>
                    <LI>+1 =</B> <B>Yes</B>, agree, or the action should be performed.&nbsp; On some issues, this vote is only binding if the voter has tested the action on their own system(s).</LI>
                    <B>
                    <LI>0</B> = <B>Abstain</B>, no opinion, or I am happy to let the other group members decide this issue. An abstention may have detrimental effects if too many people abstain. </LI>
                    <B>
                    <LI>-1 =</B> <B>No</B>. On issues where consensus is required, this vote counts as a veto. All vetoes must include an explanation of why the veto is appropriate. A veto with no explanation is void. No veto can be overruled. If 
                        you disagree with the veto, you should lobby the person who cast the veto. Voters intending to veto an action item should make their opinions known to the group immediately, so that the problem can be remedied as early as 
                        possible.&nbsp; Note that a member might veto the concept (with an adequate explanation), but later rescind that veto if a specific patch satisfies their objections.</LI>
                </UL>
                <P ALIGN=LEFT>An action item requiring consensus approval must receive at least <I>3 binding +1</I> votes and no vetoes. An action item requiring majority approval must receive at least <I>3 binding +1 votes and more +1 votes than 
                -1 votes</I>
                 (i.e., a majority with a minimum quorum of three positive votes). All other action items are considered to have lazy approval until someone votes -1, after which point they are decided by either consensus or a majority vote, depending upon the type of action item. 
                <P>The act of voting carries certain obligations because voting members are not only stating their opinion; they are agreeing to help on the voted issue. Since we are all volunteers, members often become inactive for periods of 
                time in order to take care of their &quot;real jobs&quot; or devote more time to other projects. It is therefore unlikely that the entire group membership will vote on every issue. To account for this, all voting decisions are 
                based on a minimum quorum.<P ALIGN=LEFT>Every active developer may request a voting on an issue by posting a message with a <I>Subject</I> beginning with [VOTE]</FONT><P ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT SIZE="+1"
