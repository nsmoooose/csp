<I>A</I><BR>
This product is not final.  There will be many more changes as I progress.  Things will change, so do not code any "real" project out of this yet.<BR>
This sample is built for DirectX8, and Windows95+.  This is built using MSVC6.0. <BR>

Class Architecture Flow<BR>
<BR>
The flow in this architecture goes as followed:
<BR>
<BR>
1. The operating system (OS) will start the .EXE file.
<BR>
2. The .EXE will create the "App" class and pass it an "APP_SPECIFIC_STRUCT" with all its initialization data.
<BR>
3. App is created and inherits StandardApp and StandardFramework.
<BR>
4. App will then create all the Factory Classes.
<BR>
5. The App will get the number of available "specific" objects supported by that particular Factory (shown in red above).
<BR>
6. The App will pick a "specific" object and then tell the Factory Class to create the "specific" object.
<BR>
7. The "specific" object is created and returns it's StandardClass to the App.
<BR>
8. The App then uses this StandardClass to perform all the function calls.
<BR>
9. All the objects are created, so the App deletes the Factories since they are no longer required.
<BR>
<BR>

Class Architecture Notes<BR>
<BR>
1. The way C++ works, since StandardClasses and the "specific" objects are linked together by inheritance, any action done with the StandardClasses will automatically be implemented by their "specific" object.
<BR>
2. Since the APP only has access to the StandardClasses, the APP remains platform/api independant as is required.
<BR>
3. The bubble under App is any additional/code the App requires, but this is independant from any framework components.  But any graphical, audio, networking, platform, and input requirements should be mapped through the App's StandardClass interfaces.
<BR>
4. The number of available API's and Platform depend on the preprocessors found in the .EXE file.  Under Windows, we could support OpenGL and Direct3D, so both of those preprocessors should be listed.  That way the Graphics Factory will know which API's are available on this particular platform.  Under Mac, there is no Direct3D, so it should not be included in the preprocessors and it shouldn't come up as an option in the Factory's API List.
<BR>
5. Sometimes a "specific" object will require some information from another object.  You must use the other object's StandardClass interface to contact the "specific" object (as you already know).
To check to see if a "specific" object requires another object for a dependency, call the "specific" objects "->GetDependencyCount()" function to receive a number of dependencies.
You can then call it's "->GetDependencyData()" function to retrieve information about the dependency and why it requires it.  After you determine which dependencies it requires, you can then pass the StandardClass interface of it's dependency by calling the "specific" objects "->SetDependencyData()" function call. To verify everything is setup properly on the "specific" object, call it's "->CheckStatus()" function.  Please see StandardFramework.h for more information.
