Version 0.3.2 (in progress)
===========================

2003-04-18: onsight
            Wrote a specialized vector rotation method for quaternions
	    that should be a little bit faster.
	    
	    Added DataManager.* to setup.py so it is now installed
	    properly.  DataManager is also wrapped by SWIG now.

	    More documentation in Quaternion.h.
