 * UDPSocket.
 * 
 * In addition to connected TCP sessions, Common C++ supports UDP sockets and
 * these also cover a range of functionality.  Like a TCPSocket, A UDPSocket
 * can be created bound to a specific network interface and/or port address,
 * though this is not required.  UDP sockets also are usually either 
 * connected or otherwise "associated" with a specific "peer" UDP socket.
 * Since UDP sockets operate through discreet packets, there are no streaming
 * operators used with UDP sockets.
 * 
 * In addition to the UDP "socket" class, there is a "UDPBroadcast" class.
 * The UDPBroadcast is a socket that is set to send messages to a subnet as a
 * whole rather than to an individual peer socket that it may be associated
 * with.
 * 
 * UDP sockets are often used for building "realtime" media  streaming
 * protocols and full duplex messaging services.  When used in this manner,
 * typically a pair of UDP sockets are used together; one socket is used to
 * send and the other to receive data with an associated pair of UDP sockets
 * on a "peer" host.  This concept is represented through the Common C++
 * UDPDuplex object, which is a pair of sockets that communicate with another
