 Version 0.4.0 (in progress)
===========================
2003-10-19: onsight
            Tagged r0_3_5 and started branch b0_3.  Merged 'systems'
	    branch into the trunk to start version 0.4.0.

2003-10-19: onsight
            Modified class Thrust to use simdata::Table2 instead of the
	    deprecated simdata::Table class.  Note that the XML thrust
	    tables must be modified to use this new class, but that these
	    changes will not be checked into cvs (to prevent clashes with
	    the trunk).  The corrected files will be posted at 
	    http://csp.sourceforge.net/downloads (soon) until the systems
	    branch is merged to make v0.4.0.

	    SIMDATA_OBJECT(...) changed to SIMDATA_STATIC_OBJECT(...) for 
	    object classes that are static.  This was previously specified
	    per object in the associated xml file using the 'static' attr.
	    That use is deprecated in simdata 0.4; now object classes are 
	    either static or not.

2003-10-14: onsight
            Removed very old TerrainSymbol.h

2003-10-11: onsight
            Tracked down '#define min' from windows.h (no surprise), which
	    was included via Producer/RenderSurface.  Added #undef's there
	    as a temporary fix.

	    Changed the classes related to input events and hid mapping
	    to use reference counting.

	    Moved CSP_OSG_094 to CSPSim.h.  You must uncomment this line
	    to use OSG version 0.9.4 or older.

==========> VC users add System.cpp, SystemsModel.cpp, and Systems/*.cpp
            to the project.

2003-10-09: onsight
            Fixed minor snprintf problem under msvc.

            Split the SystemsModel class out of System.h/cpp into 
	    SystemsModel.h/cpp.  This seems to be a better arrangement,
	    and hopefully circumventns a problem with forward 
	    declarations + simdata::Link<> under msvc.

2003-10-05: onsight
            Changed HID to inherit from simdata::Referenced.  Minor
	    changes to BaseScreen, GameScreen, and CSPSim to support
	    this change.

2003-09-25: onsight
            Integrated VI's patches for OSG 096 support.  Changes
	    camera handling in near/far SceneView intances in
	    VirtualScene.cpp.

            Various OSG 096 fixes:
	      * SceneView aspect ratio
	      * NearView projection matrix
	      * False horizon coloring
	      * Skydome (non-TEXDOME) coloring

	    To use OSG 094, uncomment the #define CSP_OSG_094 line
	    in VirtualScene.cpp

2003-09-17: onsight
            Major refactoring of the aircraft components in terms of
	    the System/SystemsModel architecture.  PhysicsModel is now
	    a System under the main SystemsModel for the vehicle.  The
	    BaseDynamics classes are also Systems, although they only
	    function as dynamics when placed directly underneath the
	    PhysicsModel node.  Almost all of the original inter-
	    component communications are now implemented through the
	    bus architecture.  A few hacks remain, such as the landing
	    gear sprites (which needs to be overhauled in terms of
	    standard animations once a suitable 3d model is available).

	    Significant changes to the DataRecorder interface.

	    Changed the stats display interface to allow each System
	    to add its own info lines to the display by extending
	    getInfo().

	    Changes to the XML data for the m2k to support the new
	    vehicle interfaces.

2003-09-15: onsight
            Added SynchronousUpdate.h and SynchronousUpdate.cpp as the
	    basis for a new update callback infrastructure.

2003-09-13: onsight
            Renamed Model to SystemsModel

            Removed F16Model from the build.

	    Added m_SystemsModel to DynamicObject to reference the
	    current systems model.  The setHuman() and setLocal()
	    methods now handle updates of the model, using two new
	    simdata::Path member variables: m_AgentModel and m_HumanModel.

	    SystemModel updates are now hooked into DynamicObject updates.

	    Input events are chained to the systems model if the dynamic
	    object doesn't handle them.

	    Changed the mapped input event interface.  The onCommand, 
	    onAxis, and onMotion methods of InputInterface are now
	    private, and all mapped events are passed via the onMapEvent
	    method.  Overriding these methods was generally used to pass 
	    events to subobjects, so it is easier now that only one method 
	    needs to be extended.  The raw event handlers were excluded 
	    from this interface, since raw events are more often handled 
	    by top-level objects.  MapEvent is a wrapper type that 
	    encompasses the three original types of events. 

2003-09-07: onsight
            Added Include/System.h and Include/Bus.h, which provide
	    infrastructure for constructing detailed vehicle models.
	    Several existing components such as the data recorder and
	    flight model need to be refactored to use this new
	    interface.
